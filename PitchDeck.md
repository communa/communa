## Our competitors

In the landscape of TimeTracking applications, our competition includes established players such as Hubstaff, Toggl, and Timedoctor. These platforms have gained recognition for their offerings.

Turning to freelancing marketplaces, two major platforms stand out:

1. **Upwork:** A prominent leader connecting employers with freelancers, known for its extensive user base and diverse range of projects.
2. **Braintrust:** An emerging crypto network, established in 2019, positioned as an alternative to Upwork with a focus on decentralized principles.

However, what sets us apart is our commitment to operating as open-source software. In addition to this, we go beyond conventional payment methods by providing crypto payments, particularly aimed at benefiting remote workers who may face challenges in traditional financial systems. 

This unique combination of open-source functionality, activity, and crypto payments distinguishes our platform, positioning us as a progressive and inclusive solution for the evolving needs of remote workers.

## Our vision

Communa is poised to evolve into an open-source framework, providing everyone the option to effortlessly install their white-labeled marketplace for free, much like platforms such as Mastodon.

End users will gain access to not just a singular network, such as a freelancer network, but a diverse array that includes services like reconstruction, car workshops and babysitting. This unified experience is made possible by a single user profile, enabling individuals to navigate various networks seamlessly. Notably, the reputation earned within one network, especially in the computer-related domain, will seamlessly carry over to others, thanks to the integration of blockchain layers and smart contracts.
These key problems highlight Communa's commitment to revolutionizing the freelancing landscape by providing a decentralized, transparent, and accessible framework.

## **Our plan to acquire users**

Our user acquisition strategy for the Communa network centers on the unique value proposition presented by **Communa TimeTracker**. We aim to highlight its distinctive features and benefits to attract a diverse user base, meeting the needs of both remote workers and businesses seeking efficient time-tracking solutions.

We are developing our time-tracking application, which will help remote workers track time spent while working on their projects and allow businesses to automate time tracking for their employees. Our time-tracking application is open-source and free of charge. 

**Communa TimeTracker** is our open-source alternative to Hubstaff.

## Target users

Our target users encompass two primary groups:

1. **Remote Workers:** Individuals who work remotely either as freelancers, contractors, or employees of distributed teams. They require a reliable tool to track their working hours accurately, manage projects efficiently, and ensure timely completion of tasks.
2. **Businesses:** Companies of all sizes, especially those with remote or distributed teams, seeking to automate time tracking processes for their employees. They value cost-effective solutions that enhance productivity, provide insights into employee workload, and facilitate better resource allocation.

## **Our Solution & Business Model**

Communa, as a product, will derive revenue through a **5% fee** imposed on freelancer income. The platform follows a weekly payment structure for freelancers.

Furthermore, we envisage the introduction of our utility token, COMM. Transactions between parties using COMM tokens will incur no additional charges. The Communa Token functions as the utility token for the Communa platform, operating on a blockchain network akin to Ethereum. This token acts as a medium of exchange within the platform, streamlining transactions and interactions among freelancers, clients, and the overall ecosystem.

What defines us is the desire to create a simple, convenient, free, open-source product for everyone who values their time and strictly follows a time tracker. The application of this technology is possible not only in IT but also in offline tasks, such as training, cleaning, babysitting, and mu**ch more.**

By combining a freelance marketplace, a time tracker, and a convenient payment method, we are going to create an excellent tool for solving a multitude of tasks. The usage is free and unlimited, and a commission is only charged when using the integrated crypto payments, backed by an escrow guarantee.

## **Problems to be solved**

Communa aims to address several key challenges in the remote work industry by leveraging blockchain technology with support from crypto community.

1. **Decentralized Identity:** The decentralized reputation system built on the blockchain aims to tackle issues related to trust and transparency. Freelancers often face challenges in proving the authenticity of their profiles and work history. By recording job contracts as NFTs on the blockchain, Communa provides a tamper-proof system that enables users to verify credentials and work history without relying on centralized authorities.
    - *Problem:* Existing platforms operate centrally, leading to trust issues, high fees, and limited transparency.
    - *Solution:* Communa leverages blockchain for decentralization, fostering trust, reducing costs, and ensuring transparency through smart contracts.
2. **Time-Tracking:** Communa's desktop time-tracking application aims to streamline this process, automating the tracking of working hours. It not only saves a ton of time but also simplifies invoicing and payments.
    - *Problem:* Current tracking solutions lack crypto integrations and payments.
    - *Solution:* Communa offers a free, cross-platform time tracking application, easing the burden for freelancers and promoting efficient project management.
3. **Instant Payments:** Many freelancers, encounter delays and inefficiencies in traditional payment methods. Communa's use of blockchain and stablecoins. This can significantly benefit freelancers by providing a more efficient and accessible payment solution.
    - *Problem:* Freelancers face hurdles with diverse global currencies and payment methods.
    - *Solution:* Integration with blockchain networks and stablecoins provides fast, reliable, and accessible payments worldwide, overcoming traditional banking limitations.

## Evidence of importance

Our project holds significant importance due to several pressing reasons:

1. In the current landscape, there is a glaring absence of open-source platforms tailored specifically for remote workers.
This gap limits accessibility and innovation within the freelancing community.
2. Existing platforms predominantly operate on centralized models, often imposing fees on users and maintaining control over user accounts. This centralized control introduces vulnerabilities, where user accounts can be arbitrarily blocked, jeopardizing not only their access but also their hard-earned reputation and trust within the platform's ecosystem.
    
    The repercussions of account blocking are severe for freelancers, as they risk losing their accumulated ratings and the trust they've painstakingly built over time.
    This loss not only impacts their ability to secure new projects but also undermines their credibility and livelihood in the freelance marketplace.
    
3. The lack of ownership over user profiles exacerbates these challenges. Freelancers are essentially at the mercy of platform policies, with limited control over their data and reputations. This lack of ownership not only diminishes autonomy but also undermines the trust and transparency essential for healthy freelance ecosystems.

In essence, addressing these pressing issues should be prioritized as they directly impact the livelihoods and professional well-being of freelancers worldwide. The evidence of this demand is underscored by the frustrations voiced by freelancers across existing platforms and the growing recognition within the industry for more inclusive, transparent, and decentralized solutions.
